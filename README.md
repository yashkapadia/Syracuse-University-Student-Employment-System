# Syracuse-University-Student-Employment-System
A Database Management System to manage and track the employment of international students. This Project was a part of my IST659 - Database Management System Course at Syracuse University.

## Motivation
The project provides a database design for the Syracuse University Student Employment System. It is for the 
Syracuse University to simplify the process of gaining an Employer Verification form (I-9) for international students. 
The current process requires student to go from office to office and work on hard copies. For this I have designed a 
centralized database management system to not have student travel to various offices as well as not carry original & 
sensitive documents everywhere for verification. The soft copies can easily replace hard one without any loss in any 
functionality. This system will make things easier for students as well as will simplify the process for the
offices to keep track of the employment of each student and from each employer. This database system will also help the 
employment services to find out answers to various questions like which employer is giving out the most employment, 
total amount spent in international student employment, etc.
